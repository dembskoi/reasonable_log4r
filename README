Patches for Log4r
=================

* root loggers are no longer null loggers -- you can add outputters to them
* the global logger is used to set a global log level (root is no longer used for this)
* yaml configurator has been updated to handle new root logger semantics
* yaml configurator has been updated to accept a set of files AND sections (default section: log4r_config)

What this really means is that you can set up one outputter in the root
logger to manage the default logging behavior.
